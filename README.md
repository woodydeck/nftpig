## Background and Inspiration

I cut my teeth in the dotcom boom as a teenager shorting AOL months too soon, and posting as a dot (anon) on the first Web 2.0 mass free speech message board FuckedCompany.com (known colloquially as FC). FC was a predecessor to 4chan, reddit, and Twitter.

One of the legendary sites from that era was Dack.com run by a guy known as Dack. Dack was an OG shitposter who created the Web Economy Bullshit generator. He was an early poster on FC, and did things his own way. He was also one of the inspirations for The Best Page in the Universe by Maddox (of pedo smile fame). What I remember most from that era, apart from all of the spectacular bankruptcies, was the Bullshit Generator. I never once took adults seriously when I came of age having grown up around all of these socially dangerous maniacs. They trolled the self-important for the sheer joy of feeling alive. 

As a co-founder of the very first Chainlink VRF NFT project, you can imagine my surprise when the project sold out. Amazing! However, I misunderestimicated the reason, and that pissed me off. While the art of my wife underpinning the project was absolutely amazing, most bought them to flip them for a quick profit, and then summarily everyone forgot about the project. It was one Furby frenzy after another after that. I couldn't keep up with all the schlock being 'dropped' and subsequently wash traded for thousands of ETH to scam newcomers to crypto thinking they bought something of long-term value.

My wife and I originally came to asset tokenization help stop her from being ripped off, but nobody seems to care about the technology now â€“ It's all about getting rich quick. Until the landscape improves, I'm just in this for the lulz at this point, and that's something I feel really happy about. Many from those early FC forum days ended up doing great things in life, just like the hoards of NFT flimflammers will in the Web3 world. May this useless project serve as documentation of the amazing times the pandemic gave us. Maybe some people will be inspired to learn more about how simple it is to integrate Chainlink VRF into their project. It's something that is absolutely vital.

## What does the project do?

Absolutely f-all. When you mint, you request a Chainlink VRF number that burns precious LINK and ETH gas. The VRF comes back with a number to the contract, then the contract assigns you a random phrase commemorating the insanity of NFTs in 2020-2022.

While VRF works best to secure value of assets, it can also just be used to create provenance of ephemeral actions, or assuredly worthless things like these NFTs.
